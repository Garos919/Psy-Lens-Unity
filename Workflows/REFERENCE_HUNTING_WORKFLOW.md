## 1. Setup & Folder Structure

Create a local folder named:

```
Reference_Library
```

Inside `Reference_Library`, create the following folders:

```
/Reference_Library
  /interior_layout
  /exterior_layout
  /camera_and_composition
  /lighting_and_fog
  /surfaces_and_decay
  /storytelling_details
  /overall_mood
```

Rules:

* Each image must be placed in **one** folder only
* Do not duplicate images across folders

---

## 2. Naming Rules

Each reference image must be named using the following format:

```
<first-initial><last-name-3-letters>_<number>
```

Example (Nick Garos):

```
interior_layout/ngar_1
interior_layout/ngar_2
lighting_and_fog/ngar_1
lighting_and_fog/ngar_2
```

Rules:

* Use the same prefix for all your references
* Numbering restarts per folder (each folder has its own 1, 2, 3, ...)

---

## 3. Reference Gathering

Collect visual references freely. Examples include (but are not limited to):

* Photographs (real locations, urban spaces, interiors, exteriors)
* Film or game screenshots
* Concept art
* Sketches or drawings
* AI-generated images
* Any imagery that helps express an idea or scene

No stylistic alignment is required at this stage.

---

## 4. Quantity Limits

Per folder:

* **Suggested Minimum:** 5 images
* **Maximum:** 10 images

If you want to add a new image beyond the limit:

* Remove one first

---

## 5. Handling Rules

* Keep images unedited
* Do not add text files, notes, or descriptions
* Folder structure must remain intact

---

## 6. Rule of Thumb

If an image does not clearly communicate why it belongs in a folder, replace it.
