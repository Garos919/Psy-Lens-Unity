## 1. What this folder is

A shared space for **free playable references** (small games / demos / browser experiences) used for team discussion.

All entries are intended to be **small experiences**, typically **10–15 minutes** of gameplay.

---

## 2. Where the list is

The master list is here:

* `Games/GAMES.md`

All listed entries are **free**.

## 3. How to download and run

### Browser (HTML5)

1. Open the game page link.
2. Download the build for your OS (Windows / macOS / Linux).

   * itch.io will show a tip / support prompt. Click:

     * **No thanks, just take me to the downloads**
3. Extract the `.zip` (or `.rar`/`.7z` if provided).
4. Run the game:

**Windows**

* Run the `.exe`.

**macOS**

* If macOS blocks the app: System Settings → Privacy & Security → **Open Anyway**.

**Linux**

* If needed, make the file executable:

  ```
  chmod +x ./GameName.x86_64
  ```
* Then run it.

### If controls are hard / controller does not work

Some itch.io games are keyboard-only.

Options:

* Use keyboard.
* Use Steam Input (add as non-Steam game and map keyboard → controller).
* Use a key-mapper (JoyToKey / AntiMicro).

## 4. Reviews

Reviews live here:

* `Games/Reviews/`

### Review file structure

Create one folder per game:

```
Games/Reviews/<game_name>/
```

Inside it, create one file per person:

```
Games/Reviews/<game_name>/<your_id>.md
```

Example:

```
Games/Reviews/security_booth/ngar.md
```

## 5. Review prompts

Write freely, but include points like these:

* What felt good (mood, pacing, camera, sound, level layout, tension)
* What felt bad (friction, unclear objectives, confusing UI)
* Controls (good/bad, remapping, controller support)
* Onboarding (instructions, prompts, readability)
* Settings (missing, ambiguous, confusing)
* Camera (fixed angles: what worked, what didn’t)
* Takeaways for Psy-Lens (what to borrow, what to avoid)

Keep it short and clear.

## 6. Recommendations

If you find a good free experience that should be included in `Games/GAMES.md`, send the recommendation to a coordinator.

Include:

* Game name
* Link
* OS availability (Windows / macOS / Linux / Browser)
* Very short note (1–2 lines) on why it’s worth playing
