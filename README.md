# Psy-Lens Project Repository

This repository contains the **early-stage development structure** for the Psy-Lens project.

It is organized to support:
- exploratory work
- structured asset and reference gathering
- controlled early collaboration

---

## Project Status

The project is currently in an **early exploration phase**.

Focus areas:
- building initial asset and reference libraries
- testing structure and workflows
- observing contributions to inform future rules

Workflows and rules may evolve as the project progresses.

## PSY_LENS

The `PSY_LENS/` folder contains the **Unity project**.

- Managed separately from workflows and documentation
- `.gitignore` avoids committing generated Unity data and local-only files

---

## Workflows

The `Workflows/` folder defines **how work is done** during the early exploration phase.

- `ASSET_HUNTING_WORKFLOW.md`  
  Rules for sourcing, documenting, and contributing third-party assets

- `REFERENCE_HUNT_WORKFLOW.md`  
  Rules for gathering and organizing visual references

All contributors working on assets or references must follow these workflows.

---

## Games

The `Games/` folder contains **small free playable reference experiences** used for inspiration and discussion.

- `GAMES.md` — curated list of games with links and OS availability
- `README.md` — how to download, run, and review games
- `Reviews/` — written thoughts and critiques per game

All listed games are **free** and intentionally short  
(typically **10–15 minutes** of gameplay).

---

## Contributor Rules

`CONTRIBUTOR_RULES.md` defines **project-wide rules** that apply to all contributors, including:
- contributor ID format
- Discord display name requirements
- workflow compliance

This file should be read **before** contributing.

---

## Contribution

If you are contributing:
1. Read `CONTRIBUTOR_RULES.md`
2. Follow the relevant workflow in `Workflows/`
3. Work within the defined early-stage constraints

---

## Notes

This repository is intentionally structured for **clarity and control**, not speed.  
Early limitations are deliberate and will be revised later.
