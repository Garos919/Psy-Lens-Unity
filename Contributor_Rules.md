## 1. Contributor ID

Each contributor must have a **unique contributor ID**.

Format:

```
<first-initial><last-name-3-letters>
```

Example:

* Nick Garos → `ngar`

This ID is mandatory and is used for:

* Asset Library contributor folders
* Reference Library naming
* Contributor identification across the project

---

## 2. Discord Display Name

All contributors must include their **contributor ID in their Discord server display name** (project Discord).

### Required Format

```
Display Name (id)
```

Example:

```
Nick Garos (ngar)
```

### Rules

* The display name can be anything the contributor wants
* The contributor ID must always be included
* The ID must appear after the name, inside parentheses
* This requirement applies only to the project Discord server

### How to Change Your Discord Display Name (Server-Specific)

1. Open the **project Discord server**
2. Click the **server name** at the top-left
3. Select **Edit Server Profile**
4. Change the **Server Nickname** field
5. Set it to:

   ```
   Your Name (your-id)
   ```
6. Click **Save Changes**

Example:

```
Alex (abro)
```

## 3. Scope of Work

Contributors may work on:

* Asset Hunting
* Reference Hunting
* Other tasks assigned or approved by coordinators

Contributors must follow the workflow associated with the task they are working on.

---

## 4. Workflow Compliance

All contributors must:

* Follow the **Asset Hunting Workflow** when sourcing or adding assets
* Follow the **Reference Hunt Workflow** when gathering visual references

Deviations from workflows are not allowed unless explicitly approved.

---

## 5. Early Phase Constraints

The project is currently in an **early exploration phase**.

During this phase:

* Limits defined in workflows must be respected
* Structure takes priority over volume
* Contributors should avoid over-organizing or extending workflows

These constraints may change later.

---

## 6. General Conduct

* Respect shared rules and workflows
* Keep contributions clear and traceable
* Ask before introducing new structures or conventions

Failure to follow these rules may result in contributions being excluded from the library.
